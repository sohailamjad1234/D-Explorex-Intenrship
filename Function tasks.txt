Functions in Python (Simplified Real-Life Tasks):
Task: Bill Calculator for a Restaurant

Description: Write a function that takes a list of food item prices and calculates the total bill. Optionally, the function should also calculate a tip (e.g., 10%) if the user requests it.
Hint: Use a list of prices and a function to sum them. Use an optional parameter for the tip calculation.
Task: Convert Temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius

Description: Write a function that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the temperature in Celsius.
Hint: Use the formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9.
Task: Simple Calculator

Description: Write a function that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and returns the result of the calculation.
Hint: Use conditional statements to check the operator and apply the correct operation.
Task: Create a Greeting Message

Description: Write a function that takes a user’s name and the current time of day, and returns a greeting like "Good morning, [Name]!"
Hint: Use a time_of_day parameter to personalize the greeting.
Task: Find the Largest Number in a List

Description: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.
Hint: Use Python’s built-in max() function or manually loop through the list to find the largest number.
Loops in Python (Simplified Real-Life Tasks):
Task: Print Even Numbers

Description: Write a loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 100.
Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is even, and a loop to iterate through the range.
Task: Count Down Timer

Description: Write a loop that acts as a countdown timer, starting from a number input by the user and counting down to zero.
Hint: Use a while loop to decrease the number until it reaches zero.
Task: Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to N

Description: Write a loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to a user-specified number N.
Hint: Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and keep a running total.
Task: Print Multiplication Table

Description: Write a loop that prints the multiplication table for a number provided by the user.
Hint: Use a for loop to print the product of the number and integers from 1 to 10.
Task: Count the Number of Vowels in a String

Description: Write a loop that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string.
Hint: Loop through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.
Lists in Python (Simplified Real-Life Tasks):
Task: Shopping List Organizer

Description: Create a list that stores items for a shopping list. Allow the user to add, remove, and view items from the list.
Hint: Use append() to add items, remove() to delete items, and print the list to display it.
Task: Reverse a List

Description: Write a function that takes a list and returns it reversed (e.g., input [1, 2, 3] returns [3, 2, 1]).
Hint: You can use slicing [::-1] or a loop to reverse the list manually.
Task: Find the Average of a List of Numbers

Description: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average of the numbers.
Hint: Use the sum() function to calculate the total, and then divide by the length of the list using len().
Task: Count Occurrences of an Item in a List

Description: Write a function that takes a list and an item as input and counts how many times that item appears in the list.
Hint: Use a loop to go through each element in the list and count matches.
Task: Combine Two Lists

Description: Write a function that takes two lists and combines them into a single list.
Hint: Use the + operator or the extend() method to combine the lists
